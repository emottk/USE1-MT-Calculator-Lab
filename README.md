#Build Your Own Calculator!

We have all the tools we need to build something awesome! Using your knowledge of methods, conditionals, and Ruby, we are going to build a command line calculator.		
With a partner, talk through what you want your calculator to calculate. It can be a basic math calculator, a tip calculator, a conversion calculator - the possibilities are endless! Once you've chosen your idea, map out the logic together in `calculator.rb`, and then get started!
